This mudlib is split into three major sections as indicated by these three root folders. This is to help enhance security as well as separate basic mud functionality from higher-level gameplay mechaincs. Hopefully this will make the mudlib both easier to maintain as well as more flexible for branching and modifying to mud-specific goals.


CORE
This contains all objects vital to basic mud functionality and is where the lib interfaces with the driver. This should contain little if any game-play specific code except what is required at the most fundamental level. It is hoped that any mudlibs deriving from SluggyMUD will at the very least find this section re-usable without compromising or limiting their ideas should they decide to write their own lib from 'scratch'. Only the highest level admins can gain write access to this region of the mudib and for good reason- changes could easily break the rest of the game. This will likely be the least frequestly modified area for any active mud

The following things will be found in here:
-master object
-root user object
-connection and logon duties
-administration
-driver and OS operations
-admin commands and verbs
-any systems that will likely be used throughout the mud - the component system



SECURE
This is the second level of secure code within the mudlib and will be restricted to admins and creators will 'Level 2' access (basically core coders that are trusted to work on vital systems). Here is where many important gameplay system will reside. These systems will effectively define the core of the gameplay for the mud but might change for mud-specific goals.

The following can be found here:
-account info and player save files
-gameplay config files
-core game engine -combat system, entity definitions, basic AIs, rooms, useable items, verbs, commands
-creator commands and verbs
-core commands and verbs that only trusted creators should be able to modify
-most of the sefuns

PUBLIC
This is the lowest level of secure code. It is modifyable by all creators that have access to the mudlib. This is likely where high-level objects can be stored, shared, and extended. As well, most of the locations within the game will be found here. Take note that even though this root directoy grants full access to all creators, some sub directories like the domains or creator workspaces might be more restrictive.

-domains
-creator workspaces
-assorted non-vital config files, headers, and databases
-commonly used and shared objects and components
-most commands and verbs used by players
-most logs
-most helpfiles and documentation
